# 100dayslearningPython

Hello.

I take a data science class from a learning platform, but what's bother me the most is that my habit of being detail-oriented , I wonder why a code is written that way,
when to put that, this, and that, instead of taking more seriously on the application of Python on data science. 

My mentor on the bootcamp told to the student that it would be better to understand the Python first. And through this effort,
I want to learn the Python in a more detailed way.

I bought a course from Udemy as my learning plan on Python, so I know what to learn everyday. For the narrative or my explanation on every project will be stored at
my Medium page here https://medium.com/@auliantyrany

In the name of Allah, The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful, wish me luck!
